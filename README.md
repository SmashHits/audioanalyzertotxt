# audioanalyzertotxt
import an audio track and it will analyze it into a .txt file. works as a spectrum analyzer

i personally use it for scratch projects lol. [this one](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/871290212/)

also sorry that it doesnt render fast even though this is a small project, you have to listen to the entire audio file before downloading.
i might fix this later, i just dont feel like doing it right now
